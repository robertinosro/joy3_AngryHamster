Joy Caption Alpha Two 2.1 Updated & Improved by Angry Hamster

This version is not the 4bit. It's the full GPU edited version .

It is fine tuned for full GPU performance

enhancing captions quality and generation speed!

I am not taking credit for building this from scratch. I only improved this as

many been having issues with it ( from installing to lack of options), so i

edited this and made it more accessible to everyone.

Credits for the first version go to https://civitai.com/user/devajyoti151 and

What's new?

Added : Loaded Model Status Check and progress bar

( this was an issue as often the GUI was not showing properly if model is loaded or not , causing user

to start captioning with model incompletely loaded)

Added: captioning generation progress bar

Added : Generated Caption preview & edit for single file captions (when captioning a single file, now you can preview the generated caption directly inside the GUI , edit the text and copy to clipboard )

Added custom Camera Angles option. Now you can insert directly inside the generated Caption preview the desired camera angle and use it for your AI image gen prompt or for lora training.

The full list with description can be also found inside the ress folder

Added: save edited caption ( it will overwrite the already generated caption inside the images directory where it was initially saved )

Full working version, no need to install anything!
